**Be bording, be dumb.**

Make components from cross-browser web standards without thinking too hard. 

Code like you'll fix it at 4AM with a hanover becuase you might.

No JSX, no Shadow DOM, no fancy framworks, no opinions.

- **Just HTML, CSS and JavaScript**—No JSX, no Shadow DOM, no fancy frameworks, no opinions. 
- **Stop learning, stagnate!**—Use the syntax you already know. Stop learning new things. Do more with what's already here.
- **Crazy and fun, but in a serious way**—Dumbass is the tool for people who don't want to think too hard to make UI. 

*To learn more*...oh wait, you already know enough. 

### Gorgeous Dumbass

```javascript     
function Spin(n) {
  return R`  
    <div 
      wheel:passive=${spin}
      touchmove:passive=${move}
    >
      <h1>
        <progress 
          max=1000
          value=${n}
        ></progress>
        <hr>
        <input 
          input=${step}
          type=number 
          value=${n}>
    </div>
  `;
}
```
