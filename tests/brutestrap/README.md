# brutestrap (v1.0.2)

A port of Blueprint/React-Bootstrap UI kit components to Brutal.js and CSS Grid, energized by the pursuit of minimalist code and minimalist design in all things.

```JavaScript
[...new Set([...Blueprint, ...Bootstrap])].map(convertTo(Brutal.js, CSSGrid)).filter(minimalistCode)
```

## Roadmap / TODO list

*Note: the choice of whether the component is from Blueprint or Bootstrap depends on which I think looks more like what I want.*

- ~Blueprint text inputs~
- ~Blueprint tag inputs~
- ~Blueprint file inputs~
- ~Spinner~
- ~Button with spinner~
- Live updating fuzzy search input (e.g: "type your city...", "skill...", "topic...")
- Drawer
- Toast
- Dialog
- Menu
